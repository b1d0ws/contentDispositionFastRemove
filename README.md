# Content Disposition Fast Remove

## Description

This extension streamlines testing for image uploads by automatically clearing all content or only image-based content within multipart form-data requests. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large image files, eliminating the need for manually selecting and deleting the content.

Additionally, the extension offers two options: replacing the image content with either the EICAR test file or a PHP webshell payload. These options facilitate common security tests involving file upload vulnerabilities, saving time and enhancing efficiency during assessments.
